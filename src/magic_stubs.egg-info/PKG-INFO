# Magic Stubs

**Magic Stubs** implements your functions for you.

## Demo


## Technology

MagicStubs.py uses a combination of abusing source code encodings, LLM calls, and AST rewriting so you don't have to bother writing code.

## Installation

```sh
pip install magic_stubs
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

## Usage

Add `# coding: magic_stubs` to the top of your python file. Then execute as normal.

hello_world.py:
```python
# coding: magic_stubs

def print_hello_world():
    pass

print_hello_world()
```

```sh
$ python3 hello_world.py 
Hello, World!
```
